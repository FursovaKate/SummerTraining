To refactor the algorithm Task 2 Module 3 (delegates and standard interfaces do not use), allowing to sorting both in ascending and descending, depending on comparison criterion of the matrix rows. Develop unit-tests using varioгs comparison criterion of the matrix rows.
Develop a geometric shapes class hierarchy - Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle. Classes should describe the properties of a shape and have methods for calculating the area and perimeter of the shape. (A task with an emphasis on building an inheritance hierarchy, without unduly detailed implementation).
Create Polynomial class for working with polynomials of degree n > 0 of one real variable (as an internal structure for storing coefficients use the sz-array). Override the necessary methods of the System.Object Type and also overload base operations for working with polynomials. Develop unit-tests.
